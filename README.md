# AI-HW-Projects
Coursework for Artificial Intelligence course in Sharif University of Technology.
Project1:
In this massive project, which has six parts, programs have been written in Python and MATLAB in order to reach the desired results and analyze them with the help of a multilayer perceptron neural network and adjust its parameters using NumPy and PyTorch.
Project2:
In this project, a program was written (in Python) language to estimate the rule of a function whose rule is not known and was sampled only at specific points, using genetic programming, NumPy framework, and matplotlib.
